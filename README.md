# -Introduction
This repository provides datasets for **fire protection facility detection** and **building material classification**.All datasets are fully annotated and have been pre-split into training and testing sets.

Dataset 
**FF-Data** is a fire protection facility dataset consisting of images mostly collected from real-world environments. It covers nine categories commonly found in practical scenarios, including:
- Fire extinguisher  
- Sprinkler   
- Fire door  
- Detector  
- Fire alarm   
- Fire hydrant  
- Emergency lighting  
- Exit
- Fire shutter

The fire protection facility dataset is suitable for object detection tasks and demonstrates stable performance across multiple detection models, including 
YOLOv3n, YOLOv5n, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet.

**Material-Data** is a building material dataset designed for classification tasks. It includes four major categories of construction materials that cover most primary structural components in existing buildings:
- Brick and Mortar  
- Concrete  
- Steel  
- Timber

The Building material dataset is designed for classification task and shows consistent performance across various mainstream classification models，including 
Yolo-ResNet50，Yolo-ResNet101，VGGNet-19、MobileNetv2、DenseNet121、EfficientNet-B0
